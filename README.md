# Theoretical Neuroscience Exercises
Matlab resolutions to some exercises of the book Theoretical Neuroscience by Peter Dayan and L.F. Abbot. There is also a Tex file that sums up the main concepts and equations useful to understand the theory behind the computing. I take absolutely no credit for any of these information, you can find it all in the book quoted.
